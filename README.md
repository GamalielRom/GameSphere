GameSphere
GameSphere is a video game website that provides information about the most popular games in the community. It features a landing page where users can select their preferred gaming platform: Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.

Once a platform is selected, users are redirected to a dedicated page displaying all available video games from that platformâ€™s database. Each game preview includes an image, title, and genre. When a user clicks on a game card, they are taken to a detailed page containing a brief game description, user reviews, a trailer, official website links, and additional information. This helps users make informed decisions before purchasing a game.

Please note that the data displayed on the website is randomly generated, so some information may not be entirely accurate.

Please remember if you want to give it a try you have to run the next command: npx ts-node Sources/Routes/server.ts in that way you can run the server in local host and then use a extension like Live Server to see the pages with the information from the database.

If you want to test the CRUD operation please install THUNDER and run the server 
http://localhost:300/videogames For example if you want to see all the videogames in the database.
