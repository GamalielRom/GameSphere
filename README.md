#GameSphere
GameSphere is a video game website that provides information about the most popular games in the community. It features a landing page where users can select their preferred gaming platform—Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.

Once a platform is selected, users are redirected to a dedicated page displaying all available video games from that platform’s database. Each game preview includes an image, title, and genre. When a user clicks on a game card, they are taken to a detailed page containing a brief game description, user reviews, a trailer, official website links, and additional information. This helps users make informed decisions before purchasing a game.

Please note that the data displayed on the website is randomly generated, so some information may not be entirely accurate.
